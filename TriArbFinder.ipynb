For instance, if I was prepared to pay USD1 for an apple, and you know you can get one from the store for 50 cents, the rational thing for you to do is to purchase one from the store and sell it to me, and net 50 cents in the process. A similar logic applies on the stock market. For example, the stock A trades for USD100 on the NYSE while, at the same time, it trades for USD101 at the Shanghai Stock Exchange. You can buy the stock from the NYSE and immediately sells it on the Shanghai market, earning a profit of USD1\n","\n","Notice, however, that buying the stock will exert upward pressure on the stock’s price on NYSE, and similarly, selling will impose downward price pressure on Shanghai market. As a result of this dynamic, the spread in the stock’s prices on the two marketplaces will narrow down until arbitrage is unprofitable. Due to the vast number of investors scanning these exploitable price discrepancies on a sub-second scale, they are rare and short-lived in a liquid market such as the stock market, or the cryptocurrency market for that matter. \n","\n","**What is triangular arbitrage?**\n","\n","Triangular arbitrage is the result of a discrepancy between three assets - often currencies - that occurs when the currencies exchange rates do not exactly match up. This enables the trader to trade the first currency to the second, the second to third, and the third back to the first, so that she nets a small profit in the process. The following example may help understanding the idea:\n","\n","Let us assume you have $1 million, and you observe the following exchange rates on the market: USD/EUR = 0.8698; GBP/EUR = 1.3021; and GBP/USD = 1.5028. Can you make money through triangular arbitrage? Yes, you can, through the following operations.\n","\n","* Sell dollars for euros: USD1,000,000 x 0.8698 = EUR869,800\n","* Sell euros for pounds: EUR869,800 / 1.3021 = GBP667,997.85\n","* Sell pounds for dollars: GBP667,997.85 x 1.5028 = USD1,003,867.17\n","\n","You started with USD1 million, and ended up with USD1,003,867.17, implying the net profit was USD3,867.17, or roughly 0.39%. Notice, that it does not matter which of the three currencies is the \"starting currency\" held in beginning, as long as the trades are the same and come in same order in the loop.\n","\n","Now, you may think that a USD4k profit a abysmal considering you had USD1 million capital, but notice that you made it instantaneously, and thus, you can potentially make hundreds of such trades in a day. Indeed, making frequent trades with large capital in hopes of small profits is the essence of arbitrage trading.\n","\n","Now, it should go without saying that in practice, arbitrage of any kind is not the kind of money printing machine that the example above would you make you think. There many, many factors that make arbitrage trading *significantly* more challenging in practice than on paper. Among the main obstacles are fees and bid-ask spreads (though they are accounted for in my implementation), the sheer number of professional, highly optimized, lightning-fast algorithms competing for the same marginal profit, and rapid price fluctuations.\n","\n","**This project**\n","\n","This notebook contains a triangular arbitrage finder for the cryptocurrency market. It scans continuously the prices of all cryptocurrency pairs traded on Binance through a websocket, and reports back when it has identified a profitable triangular arbitrage opportunity with instructions about which currencies to trade and at which price. In other words, it automates the process of finding opportunities such as the example above. \n","\n","While it would be relatively straightforward to hook up a trading logic and portfolio management algorithm to the finder, this algorithm is not intended for actual trading purposes. First, Python is prohibitively slow for trading at sub-second scale. Second, being based on for loops, the algorithm itself is not optimized for speed. Third, one would want to specify on a handful of currencies which are tracked and traded; tracking thousands of assets adds unnecessary computational overhead.  Lastly, the algorithm does not take into account orderbook depth and prices at different depth levels.\n","\n","-----"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"IKrTGPdIGXtP"},"source":["**Install and import dependencies**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":9757,"status":"ok","timestamp":1663424406408,"user":{"displayName":"Hemmo Karja","userId":"01530143409520555135"},"user_tz":-180},"id":"lLQ4BHW3vj49","outputId":"fa2f6805-5179-440c-e81f-b12bea2b33ee"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Looking in indexes: https://pypi.org/simple, https://us-python.pkg.dev/colab-wheels/public/simple/\n","Requirement already satisfied: ccxt in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (1.93.66)\n","Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2018.1.18 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from ccxt) (2022.6.15)\n","Requirement already satisfied: requests>=2.18.4 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from ccxt) (2.23.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: yarl==1.7.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from ccxt) (1.7.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: setuptools>=60.9.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from ccxt) (65.3.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: cryptography>=2.6.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from ccxt) (38.0.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: aiodns>=1.1.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from ccxt) (3.0.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: aiohttp>=3.8 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from ccxt) (3.8.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: multidict>=4.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from yarl==1.7.2->ccxt) (6.0.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: typing-extensions>=3.7.4 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from yarl==1.7.2->ccxt) (4.1.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: idna>=2.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from yarl==1.7.2->ccxt) (2.10)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pycares>=4.0.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from aiodns>=1.1.1->ccxt) (4.2.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: asynctest==0.13.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from aiohttp>=3.8->ccxt) (0.13.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: frozenlist>=1.1.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from aiohttp>=3.8->ccxt) (1.3.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: aiosignal>=1.1.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from aiohttp>=3.8->ccxt) (1.2.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<3.0,>=2.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from aiohttp>=3.8->ccxt) (2.1.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: async-timeout<5.0,>=4.0.0a3 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from aiohttp>=3.8->ccxt) (4.0.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: attrs>=17.3.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from aiohttp>=3.8->ccxt) (22.1.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: cffi>=1.12 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from cryptography>=2.6.1->ccxt) (1.15.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pycparser in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from cffi>=1.12->cryptography>=2.6.1->ccxt) (2.21)\n","Requirement already satisfied: chardet<4,>=3.0.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from requests>=2.18.4->ccxt) (3.0.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: urllib3!=1.25.0,!=1.25.1,<1.26,>=1.21.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from requests>=2.18.4->ccxt) (1.24.3)\n","Looking in indexes: https://pypi.org/simple, https://us-python.pkg.dev/colab-wheels/public/simple/\n","Requirement already satisfied: websocket-client in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (1.4.1)\n"]}],"source":["%pip install ccxt\n","%pip install websocket-client"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":411,"status":"ok","timestamp":1663424406811,"user":{"displayName":"Hemmo Karja","userId":"01530143409520555135"},"user_tz":-180},"id":"-2mRlH_RvgPR"},"outputs":[],"source":["import ccxt\n","import requests\n","import websocket\n","import json\n","from pprint import pprint\n","import time\n","from datetime import datetime"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"6ksY-NqH9Olo"},"source":["**Finder class**\n","\n","The outline of the two main class methods:\n","\n","**find_paths():** For finding all tradable triangular paths on Binance.
